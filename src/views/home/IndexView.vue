          Multiple Linear Regression Machine Learning Model of a <br />
          Smart Monitoring System for Ayungin Fish Growth
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="indent-10">
        Welcome to the research study conducted in collaboration between a dedicated team of
        researchers from the University of Rizal System â€“ Morong Campus and the Bureau of Fisheries
        & Aquatic Resources National Inland Fisheries Technology Center (BFAR - NIFTC) in Tanay,
        Rizal. This study focuses on the development and implementation of a "Multiple Linear
        Regression Machine Learning Model of a Smart Monitoring System for Ayungin Fish Growth."
      </p>

      <p class="indent-10">
        At its core, this research initiative centers around a state-of-the-art Smart Monitoring
        System meticulously engineered to track vital environmental parameters crucial for the
        optimal growth of Ayungin fish. These parameters include pH, turbidity, and temperature,
        providing real-time insights into the aquatic habitat's conditions.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-10">
        Utilizing the wealth of data collected by the Smart Monitoring System, the research team
        employs a sophisticated Multiple Linear Regression Machine Learning Model. This advanced
        algorithm leverages predictive analytics to forecast Ayungin fish weight based on the
        intricate interplay of environmental variables. By accurately predicting fish weight, the
        model facilitates proactive decision-making, enabling fisheries experts to fine-tune feeding
        strategies and ensure optimal growth conditions for Ayungin fish populations.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-10">
        Furthermore, the study incorporates a groundbreaking Feeding System accessible through a
        user-friendly website interface. This innovative feature empowers users to remotely control
        and adjust feeding schedules, ensuring precise and timely nourishment for the fish
        population. Through the seamless integration of technological advancements with traditional
        aquaculture practices, this research aims to revolutionize fish farming methodologies and
        contribute to sustainable fisheries management.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-10">
        As the research progresses, the team remains committed to exploring the synergy between
        technology and aquaculture, paving the way for a more efficient and environmentally
        conscious approach to fish growth optimization.
